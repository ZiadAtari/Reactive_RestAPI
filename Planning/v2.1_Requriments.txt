I want to test how the REST API employee registry application handles non-breaking API's by introducing a dummy extrernal verification API which asks for the IP of the client tring to access the DB using the REST API, and returns success.  

Version: 2.1
Goal: Implement Handling for Non-Blocking API's

Overview:
The Application will now be required to contact an external API (http://localhost:8080/ip?address=1.1.1.1) where the IP of the connecting client will be forwarded and a verification JSON will be returned as follows:
{
    "ip": "1.1.1.1",
    "message": "Success"
}

This verification layer will be used to test how the application handles blocking API's in its vertX environment, implementing proper error and exception handling in reactive environments.
