description: Documents the Update and revises the system docs.
---

Follow these steps to update the system documentation after a version release:

1. **Analyze Version Update**: Perform a deep analysis of the changes in the target version update folder (e.g., `Documentation/UPDATES/V4/v4.4`). This includes reviewing the:
   - `*Spec.md`: Requirements and specifications.
   - `*Plan.md`: Technical implementation strategy.
   - `*Report.md`: Final outcome and metrics.

2. **Analyze System Documentation**: Perform a deep analysis of all files in `Documentation/Systems/` to understand the current documented state of the system architecture and components.

3. **Cross-Check Alignment**: Verify that every change introduced in the version update is correctly reflected in the system documentation. Identify any gaps, outdated information, or inconsistencies.

4. **Revise Documentation**:
   - Update the relevant files in `Documentation/Systems/` to match the latest system state.
   - Update `README.md` to reflect any high-level changes or new features.
   - Ensure all information is synchronized across the documentation suite.
