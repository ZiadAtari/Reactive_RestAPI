description: Prepares skeleton

To prepare the skeleton for a new update (e.g., version 4.4):

1. **Identify the Parent Folder**: 
   - Locate the appropriate major version folder under `Documentation\UPDATES\`. 
   - For example, if the version is 4.4, the parent is `Documentation\UPDATES\V4`.

2. **Create New Version Folder**: 
   - Create a subfolder named with a lowercase 'v' prefix (e.g., `v4.4`).

3. **Populate Skeleton Files**: 
   - Create the following three files inside the new folder, using the version number (without the decimal point) as a prefix:
     - `xxSpec.md` (e.g., `44Spec.md`)
     - `xxPlan.md` (e.g., `44Plan.md`)
     - `xxReport.md` (e.g., `44Report.md`)

4. **Initialize File Content**:
   - Add basic markdown headers and placeholders to each file to ensure they are ready for use.
